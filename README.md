1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?
1. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?


A1-	The task should be a string; this is because it can be accessed simply and can be removed simply (overwritten with nothing). While making it a class could add more functionality it is unnecessary. The string can be implemented and managed more easily. Without additional features planned, it should remain a string just for its simplicity.

A2- 	If some additional features were added such as the ability to make sub-tasks that would likely require the task to be a class and add the necessary functionality to it. This obviously makes the previous question dependent on future plans. In the case were future plans are unsure or improvements are likely, it would be better to make the task a class rather than a string. This would make future changes easier.
